# üè¶ Loan Application Risk Analysis

## ‚öñÔ∏è Project Summary

This project delivers a comprehensive **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of a real-world loan application dataset. The primary goal is to uncover **risk factors for loan default**, assess **data integrity**, and generate **actionable insights** that can assist financial institutions in optimizing their lending strategies.

By applying rigorous data preprocessing, outlier detection, class imbalance investigation, and correlation analysis, the project builds a solid foundation for future predictive modeling or business rule development.

## üìö Dataset Overview

| Feature Category    | Example Features                               |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Client Demographics | `AGE`, `GENDER`, `EDUCATION`, `INCOME`         |
| Loan Attributes     | `LOAN_AMOUNT`, `DAYS_EMPLOYED`, `CREDIT_SCORE` |
| Target Variable     | `TARGET` (0: Non-default, 1: Default)          |

## üìä Data Cleaning & Missing Value Strategy

1. **Missing Value Analysis**

   ```python
   missing_percentage = df.isnull().sum() / len(df) * 100
   df = df.loc[:, missing_percentage < 30]  # Drop columns >30% missing
   ```

2. **Imputation Techniques**

   * **Numerical**: Mean/Median
   * **Categorical**: Mode or domain-defined constant

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Outlier Detection & Handling

* **IQR Method**:

  ```python
  Q1 = df[col].quantile(0.25)
  Q3 = df[col].quantile(0.75)
  IQR = Q3 - Q1
  outliers = df[(df[col] < Q1 - 1.5*IQR) | (df[col] > Q3 + 1.5*IQR)]
  ```

* **Z-Score Method**:

  ```python
  from scipy.stats import zscore
  df['zscore'] = zscore(df['LOAN_AMOUNT'])
  df = df[df['zscore'].abs() < 3]
  ```

* **Visualization**: Boxplots, scatter plots, histograms

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Class Imbalance Analysis

* **Target Distribution**:

  ```python
  df['TARGET'].value_counts(normalize=True)
  ```
* **Findings**: \~92% non-defaults, \~8% defaults (Imbalance Ratio ‚âà 11.5:1)
* **Visuals**: Pie Chart, Bar Plot, Countplot

---

## üìä Univariate, Segmented & Bivariate Analysis

### A. **Univariate**

* Histograms and density plots for `INCOME`, `AGE`, `LOAN_AMOUNT`
* Categorical bar charts for `GENDER`, `EDUCATION`

### B. **Segmented Univariate**

* Compare income distribution for `TARGET == 0` vs `TARGET == 1`
* Visualize skewness and concentration for defaulters

### C. **Bivariate**

* Scatterplots: `LOAN_AMOUNT` vs `INCOME` color-coded by `TARGET`
* Boxplots: Loan risk by `EDUCATION`, `EMPLOYMENT_TYPE`
* Heatmaps of feature-to-target correlations

---

## üîó Correlation Analysis by Segment

```python
segment_0 = df[df['TARGET'] == 0]
segment_1 = df[df['TARGET'] == 1]
correlations_0 = segment_0.corr()['TARGET'].sort_values(ascending=False)
correlations_1 = segment_1.corr()['TARGET'].sort_values(ascending=False)
```

* **Insights**: Default drivers differ by segment (e.g., income stability, previous loans)
* Use cases: Customized scoring or risk model tuning per segment

---

## üìä Key Business Insights

* High default probability in clients with:

  * Low and inconsistent income
  * Higher loan amounts relative to income
  * Certain employment types and education levels

* Outliers and missing values, if ignored, can distort risk predictions

* Class imbalance must be addressed before modeling (SMOTE, ADASYN recommended)

---

## üö® Limitations & Future Enhancements

* No time series tracking of customer behavior
* Predictive models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) can be built as next step
* Integrate Power BI or Tableau dashboards for stakeholder presentation

| üß† **Key Insights & Recommendations** |
| ------------------------------------- |

### üìå Behavioral Patterns of Defaulters:

* Tend to be **younger**, **lower income**, and **less stable employment**
* Often have **lower external credit scores**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management Tips:

* Apply **stricter criteria** or deeper assessment for applicants:

  * Younger than 30
  * Earning under 100k
  * With short employment history (< 1 year)
* Consider **data balancing techniques** (e.g., SMOTE or weighted models) before training classifiers.

### üìà Feature Importance:

* `EXT_SOURCE_3`, `DAYS_BIRTH`, and `AMT_INCOME_TOTAL` are **high-value predictors** for model building.

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts:

Your analysis has revealed key factors that can help **predict and prevent loan defaults**, making it possible to build **targeted risk models** and **policy rules** to safeguard the institution‚Äôs loan portfolio.
